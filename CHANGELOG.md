# Changelog

## Version 1.0.1

### Fixed

- There was a bug with TaskFlow internally in deal.ii. Fixed for now by simply disabling taskflow in deal.ii.
- deal.ii changed its interface for dealii::SolutionTransfer. Adapted the corresponding methods.

### Changed

- The FlowingVariables classes are now in separate namespaces. For finite elements, use DiFfRG::FE::FlowingVariables, for pure variable systems use DiFfRG::FlowingVariables.
